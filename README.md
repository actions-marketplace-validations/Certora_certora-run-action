# Certora Run GitHub Action

This repository contains a Certora Run GitHub Action that allows you to run Certora Prover
on your contracts in parallel, receive the results as a comment on the pull request.

## Usage

To use this action, add the [Certora Run Application] to the repository and add
the following to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  certora_run_submission:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      statuses: write
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Submit verification jobs to Certora Prover
        uses: Certora/certora-run-action@v2
        with:
          # Add your configurations as lines, each line is separated.
          # Specify additional options for each configuration by adding them after the configuration.
          configurations: |-
            tests/evm/conf-verified.conf
            tests/evm/conf-verified.conf --rule monotone --method "counter()"
            tests/evm/conf-verified.conf --rule invertible
            tests/evm/conf-verified.conf --method "counter()"
          solc-versions: 0.7.6 0.8.1
          job-name: "Verified Rules"
          certora-key: ${{ secrets.CERTORAKEY }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This action will download all the specified Solidity versions, start `certora-cli` on
every configuration file, and run the tests asynchronously. If one of the configurations
fails to start, the action will be marked as failed, and all other jobs will continue to run.

Once all the tests are finished, `Certora Run GitHub Application` will mark the commit
statuses as either `success` or `failure`, and comment on the pull request with the
results.

Both solidity compilers and `certora-cli` dependencies are cached between runs.

Example:

```yaml
name: Certora Prover Submission Workflow
description: |-
  This workflow submits Certora Prover jobs on the specified configurations. Once all
  jobs are successfully submitted, it will add a pending commit status to the commit.
  This status will be periodically updated with verification results of the jobs, along
  with the verification summary comment on the pull request.

### Permissions

This action requires the following permissions:

- `contents: read` - Clone the repository and read the configuration files.
- `statuses: write` - Write the status of the run to the GitHub UI.
- `pull-requests: write` - Write the run status & comment on the pull request.
- `id-token: write` - enables GitHub to request a signed OIDC token.

besides the permissions, the action requires the following secrets:

- `CERTORAKEY` - API key for Certora Prover.

### Inputs

General inputs for:

- `configurations` - List of configuration files to run.
- `cli-version` - Version of the `certora-cli` to use (optional). By default, the latest version is used. This action is compatible with versions `7.9.0` and above.
- `cli-release` - Release type of the `certora-cli` to use (optional). Default is `stable`.
  Options are `stable`, `alpha`, `beta`, or a custom branch name. Everything other than
  `stable` should only be used for testing purposes and is not recommended for production use.
- `ecosystem` - Name of the CLI ecosystem, the options are `evm`, `solana`, `soroban`, and `sui`. `evm` is the default ecosystem.
- `server` - Server to run the tests on (optional). Default is `production`.
- `job-name` - Name of the job (optional).
- `install-java` - Install Java for type checking (optional). Default is `true`.
- `compilation-steps-only` - Compile the spec and the code without sending a
  verification request to the cloud (optional). Default is `false`.
- `comment-fail-only` - Add a report comment to the pr only when the job fails (optional). Default it `true`.
- `certora-key` - API key for Certora Prover.
- `working-directory` - Working directory to run the action in (optional). Default is the root of the repository.
- `use-hard-links` - Whether to use hard links when copying files (optional). If you expect to modify the files in the run directory during `certoraRun` execution, you should set this to `false`.
- `debug-level` - Debug level for the action (optional). Default is `0`. Possible values are `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. Higher values will produce more debug output.

EVM specific inputs (`ecosystem: evm`):

- `solc-versions` - List of Solidity versions to download. The first version in the list
  will also be available as `solc` in the environment. Each version will be available as
  both `solc<version>` and `solc-<version>` in the environment.
- `solc-remove-version-prefix` - Prefix to remove from the Solidity version (optional).
- `vyper-version` - The version of Vyper to install. Can be `latest`, or a specific
  version like `0.3.3`. If not specified, Vyper will not be installed.

Solana specific inputs (`ecosystem: solana`):

- `rust-version` - The version of Rust to install. If not specified, the latest stable version will be used. The minimum supported version is `1.82.0`.
- `rust-additional-versions` - Additional versions of Rust to install, separated by spaces. Example: `1.75 1.79`.
- `certora-sbf-version` - The version of `cargo-certora-sbf` to install. If not specified, the latest version will be used.
- `certora-sbf-options` - Additional options to pass to the `cargo certora-sbf` command. This can be used to specify additional flags or configurations for the Certora SBF tool.
- `rust-setup` - Whether to set up Rust for Solana. The default is `true`. If you need more control over the Solana installation or options, you could use the
  [Certora Rust Setup Action](https://github.com/Certora/rust-setup-action) directly in your workflow.

### 🧩 Note: Installing the Sui CLI

This action does not automatically install the Sui CLI.
If your workflow requires running Sui commands, make sure the CLI is installed beforehand.
You can install it manually using the following commands:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MystenLabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
suiup install -y sui@testnet
```

### 🧩 Note: Installing the Soroban Environment

Specifying the Soroban ecosystem **does not** automatically install the Rust toolchain required for building Soroban WASM from source.
If you plan to compile Soroban contracts in your workflow, ensure that all dependencies are available.

You typically need:

- **`just` and the Rust toolchain**. These can be installed via GitHub Actions:
  - `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1`
  - `extractions/setup-just@v3`

- **The WASM compilation target** required by Soroban:
  ```sh
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

- **A Cargo lockfile.**
  If you do not want to commit it in your repository, you can generate it from the action
  by running, for example:
  ```sh
  cargo update -p cvlr-soroban
  ```

### Comments on the Pull Request

First, it will add a comment with details about runs:

![GitHub PR Comments](/static/comments.png?raw=true "GitHub PR Comments")

Then you can see the live status of the runs:

![GitHub PR Status](/static/status.png?raw=true "GitHub PR Status")

And finally, once the first job finishes, GH App will add and update a review with the results:

![GitHub PR Review](/static/reviews.png?raw=true "GitHub PR Review")

## Migration from v1 to v2

If you are migrating from v1 to v2, you need to update the action reference in your workflow file:

- **Permissions**: In order to provide verification using [GitHub OIDC], we need to
  enable `id-token: write` permission. This way we can authenticate to Certora
  and verify that [Certora Run Application] was installed on the repository.
  Update your workflow file to include the `id-token: write` permission:

```diff
permissions:
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write
+  id-token: write
```

- **CLI Release**: The `use-beta`/`use-alpha` inputs have been replaced with `cli-release`. The
  default value is `stable`, so if you want to use the beta version, you need to
  specify it explicitly:

```diff
      - name: Submit verification jobs to Certora Prover
-       uses: Certora/certora-run-action@v1
+       uses: Certora/certora-run-action@v2
        with:
          configurations: |-
            tests/evm/conf-verified.conf
          solc-versions: 0.7.6 0.8.1
-         use-beta: true
+         cli-release: beta
```

## Development Setup

For local development, you can use the [act] tool to run
the action locally. The easiest way to set up everything is through a combination of
[nix] and [direnv].

In order to set up the environment, follow these steps:

```bash
direnv allow
```

Then, you can run the action with the following command:

```bash
act workflow_dispatch \
    -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
    -s CERTORAKEY="$CERTORAKEY" \
    -W .github/workflows/main.yml \
    --container-architecture=linux/amd64
```

For testing, please create a PR using the [Certora Action Test] repository. The PR should
start several workflows on all of our environments.
